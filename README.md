This is a small project I did for the 'CST Hackathon' at the University of Bedfordshire. I wasn't able to achieve everything I wanted as I was really ill, but I managed to get something working.

There's still more I'd like to add and see where the project goes.

## Scenario 10
### Target: E2ee Chat lock
*Level: Hard*
I'd say is fair to assume that our privacy is the most important thing that we got, even tho not so many of us realize how dangerous the internet can be. More and more often you can see people intercepting the wireless traffic in populated areas such as airports, coffee shops or bars with the aid of small computers such as raspberry pi. Most of the times the channel that you use to communicate with your beloved ones, share pictures and videos are not that secure as you would probably think. Your task is to design a safe way of communication where parties can interact per to per or in groups in real-time and also be implementing end-to-end encryption. Besides that, they also have to be able to share pictures, videos or any other files.
